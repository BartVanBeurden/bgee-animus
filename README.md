## Description

Animus is a mod adding a talking sword to the game. The blade communicates telepathically with you and you can learn a little about the sword's past, roleplay a little and also read a few short stories. Speak to the sword again after you've discovered your true heritage and it will get a little upgrade at the cost of the conversations.

The sword can be bought in the Nashkel store.
If you are installing this mod after visiting the store, you can cheat:

    CLUAConsole:CreateItem("E)ANIMU1")
    CLUAConsole:CreateItem("E)ANIMU2") - transformed
