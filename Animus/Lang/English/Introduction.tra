@1000 	= ~(As you grip the weapon, thoughts that are not your own flash through your mindâ€¦)~

@1010	= ~What...what is this? Do I feel a spark of life stirring within me once more? Peculiar... It feels as if I have been sleeping for a long time, longer than ever before. Greetings, wielder, I am Animus, the spirit inhabiting your blade.~
@1011	= ~My sword can speak!?~
@1012	= ~Aargh!~
@1013	= ~A sentient weapon? Interesting.~
@1014	= ~<attempt to throw the sword away>~

@1020	= ~Very astute of you. I am indeed capable of elocution, even eloquence - which is more than can be said for most of my previous wielders. Hopefully you will prove to be less of a...disappointment. Regardless, that is of little interest to you, I am sure. I would much rather discuss you.~
@1030	= ~Wonderful, it appears that in my infinite good fortune I have been granted a wielder even more foolish than my last. With any luck my initial impression will be proved false. Perhaps you would be amenable to sharing a little information about yourself?~
@1040	= ~Well observed, wielder. I must confess that I was expecting a more...hasty...response. You cannot imagine the vast number of fools who I have had the misfortune to work with during my inhabitance of this blade. Perhaps you would be willing to converse with me further-I would be interested to know a little more of my current master.~

@1050	= ~Wait! Please, good wielder, I beg you-do not be so quick to discard me. I may not appear particularly impressive, but I assure you I am somewhat more powerful than my current state would suggest.~
@1051	= ~<throw the sword away>~
@1052	= ~Is that so? Perhaps I can make good use of you.~

@1060	= ~Of course, I fully understand if you are not willing to share your thoughts with a mere blade. If the fancy takes you, I would be pleased to speak with you again.~
@1070	= ~I would hope so, wielder. Perhaps you would be amenable to sharing a little information about yourself?~
